    # The following are recommended by the SSH Book
    # The GatewayPorts value forbids remote clients from connecting to locally forwarded ports.
    # The StrictHostKeyChecking value warns you of any changed host keys and asks what you want to do.
    # For X11 forwarding we elect to generate a new, untrusted xauth key rather than inherit the trust already in effect.
